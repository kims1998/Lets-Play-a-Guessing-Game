# Lets-Play-a-Guessing-Game
To the surprise of the user, this repository is for generating a random password.


Within this very difficult homework, I was able to apply the Javascript I learned the past few days.

In this project, I did not mess with any of the HTML or CSS, this was purely JS.
THIS TIME I MADE SURE TO INSERT COMMENTS, because I forgot to add them last time.

The first lines of code I put in were for the charSet on lines 18 to 26.
    In these lines of code, they are separated by the charCode (Special characters, upper and lowercase, and numbers.)

    Once this was set up I made the prompt that would display to the user:
            How many characters they'd like
            Whether they'd like to add:
                    Uppercase letters
                    Lowercase Letters
                    Special characters
                    Numbers
    In the event that the user chose to say no to all four options, I added a line of code to prompt the user that they need to choose at least one of the four.

    Along with that, if the user chose a number below 8 and above 128 characters, they are prompt letting them know that they need to choose a number within the range provided.

    As the user chooses out of the four options, it will start pulling random strings to generate a randomized password.

    This photo shows the password generator in works, the user had chosen a certain amount of characters and said yes to every option.
